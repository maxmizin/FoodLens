Figure 1: confidence_error_heatmap: Confidence-error heatmap reveals model calibration quality across classes and confidence levels. Darker colors indicate higher error rates, exposing regions of overconfidence where the model assigns high probabilities to incorrect predictions.

Figure 2: ethical_flow_diagram: Ethical decision flow diagram illustrates the abstention mechanism as a safety gate. Low-confidence predictions (p < tau) trigger human review, while high-confidence cases proceed to automated decision, balancing efficiency with safety.

Figure 3: risk_density_curve: Risk density curves show that incorrect predictions concentrate at higher risk levels, validating the abstention mechanism's ability to identify uncertain cases that benefit from human review.

Figure 4: interpretability_panel: Comprehensive interpretability panel provides multi-faceted analysis: (A) confidence distributions, (B) per-class calibration, (C) accuracy-coverage trade-offs, and (D) per-class error rates, enabling holistic understanding of model behavior.
